Description: A series of functions which aid in both simulating and determining the properties of finite, discrete-time, discrete state markov chains.  Two functions (DTMC, MultDTMC) produce n iterations of a Markov Chain(s)  based on transition probabilities and an initial distribution.  The function FPTime determines the first passage time into each state.  The function statdistr determines the stationary distribution of a Markov Chain.
